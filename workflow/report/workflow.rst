This is an automatic report from an execution of GenErode, 
created by Snakemake. 

Each subsection in the Result section contains a brief 
description of the output and links to some of the output 
files and the code used to generate them.
If you publish any research using results produced with 
GenErode, please cite our publication and refer to the source code.

Result sections are available for the following pipeline steps:

- BAM file processing
- mlRho
- PCA (plink)
- Runs of homozygosity (ROH; plink)
- snpEff
- GERP

Please set all steps to "True" in the config.yaml file that you 
would like to include into the report.
